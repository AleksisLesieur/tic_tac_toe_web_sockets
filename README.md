Welcome to the Online Tic Tac Toe Game! This project allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against a designated opponent. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

## Features
- **Play Against Me:** You can play against me, the creator of this game.
- **Notification System:** When you visit the page, I will receive a notification on my ntfy app, indicating that someone wants to play against me.
- **Alternate Opponent:** In case I'm unavailable, you can play against somebody else in the office.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - SVG Animations

- **Backend:**
  - FastAPI (Python)
  - Websockets

## How to Play
1. Visit [https://tic-tac-toe-pus7t.ondigitalocean.app/](https://tic-tac-toe-pus7t.ondigitalocean.app/) to access the game.
2. Input a name between 1-15 characters long.
3. Confirm your name and wait for me to join.
4. If I'm not joining after 2 minutes, feel free to play against one of your colleagues.
5. You're now playing a game of Tic Tac Toe with me!

## Note
- **Limited Players:** Only two players are allowed to join the game at a time. This means no third or fourth user can join.
- **Availability:** Please note that I might not always be available to play. In such cases, feel free to play against someone else in the office.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback, suggestions, or encounter any issues while playing the game, please feel free to create an issue on GitHub or reach out to me directly.

Thank you for playing! Have fun!
